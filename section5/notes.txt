### Higher-Order Functions
haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values.
A function that does either of these things is called a higher-order function.



### Curried Functions
default- one parameter - function 
mulitple parameter done by curried function

 
### Sectioning
Sectioning refers to surrounding an infix function with parentheses and providing only one of its operator
this creates a new function that takes the missing operand as it argument
example:
3+5 -- applies + to 3 and 5

( +5) -- right operand is fixed
(5+ ) -- left operand is fixed

( ++ "Hello") -- right part is fixed - <text>Hello
("Hello" ++ ) -- left part is fixed -- Hello<text>
