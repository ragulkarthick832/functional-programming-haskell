### Higher-Order Functions
haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values.
A function that does either of these things is called a higher-order function.



### Curried Functions
default- one parameter - function 
mulitple parameter done by curried function

 
### Sectioning
Sectioning refers to surrounding an infix function with parentheses and providing only one of its operator
this creates a new function that takes the missing operand as it argument
example:
3+5 -- applies + to 3 and 5

( +5) -- right operand is fixed
(5+ ) -- left operand is fixed

( ++ "Hello") -- right part is fixed - <text>Hello
("Hello" ++ ) -- left part is fixed -- Hello<text>



-- important -- sectioning can be applied for the function which can be represented in infix notation


### Printing Functions
when we type 2+2 in ghci terminal, result 4 is calculated and show result is initiated


### takeWhile
predicates and a list
starting at the beginnning of the list, it returns the list's elements as long as the predicate holds true. Once an element is found for which 
the predicate doesn't hold true, the function stops and and returns the resulting list.


### Lambdas
lambdas are anonymous functions that we use when we need a function only once
